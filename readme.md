FilePile is a simple file browser for the iPhone. It lets you poke around the file structure, starting from the root directory. You can look at where all the camera pictures are stored, see previews of images, and view all the available attributes on any file.

As this is not available on the App Store, you need a developer license to compile and download it onto your iPhone.
